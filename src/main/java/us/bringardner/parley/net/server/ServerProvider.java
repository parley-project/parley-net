 * parley-core's plugins: {@code META-INF/services/us.bringardner.parley.net.server.ServerProvider}),
 * so a launcher runs any set of servers, alone or several in one JVM, without depending on their
 * modules. Each listener is one provider: SMTP's MX and submission servers are two, POP3 and POP3
 * with implicit TLS are two.
 * <p>
 * A provider makes its server from that server's own configuration (its settings files, the JVM's
 * settings and the command line, see {@link LaunchSettings#configuration(String)}): the server is
 * written as if it were alone, and two servers in one JVM can have different values for one name.
 * A provider written before configurations ({@link #usesConfiguration()} false) reads the system
 * properties instead, which the launcher then sets from the files.
